The objective of the student attendance management system is to reduce the time that is consumed when attendance is taken manually. Unlike the manual process, an online system easily helps management to analyse studentâ€™s attendance details as per requirement.

A detailed summary of student attendance history can be obtained in an instant.

### Back-end
we are using PHP to connect and retrieve information from DB, to call the functions and also to perform the action requested on the webpage.<br>
we are using mySQL for storing student details and retrieving information and as mentioned before we are using PHP for establishing link between webpages and DBs<br>
